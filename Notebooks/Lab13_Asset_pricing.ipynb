    "### 🎯 Lab Philosophy: The Three-Act Drama of Asset Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab tells the story of how asset pricing evolved from theoretical elegance to empirical pragmatism to data-driven discovery. Think of it as a three-act drama:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Act I - The Theoretical Crisis (1985)**: Economists built beautiful consumption-based models to explain stock returns. The math was elegant, the intuition clear. Then Mehra and Prescott calculated what the model actually implied... and it was absurd. To match observed stock returns, investors would need to be terrified of risk in ways that contradict everything we observe about human behavior. This was the **Equity Premium Puzzle** - not just a minor calibration issue, but a fundamental crisis for macroeconomic theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Act II - The Empirical Revolution (1993)**: Unable to fix the theory, Fama and French took a radical step: forget about consumption, let's just see what *actually* predicts stock returns in the data. They discovered that three simple factors - market exposure, firm size, and value - could explain most of the variation in stock returns. The model worked brilliantly... but *why* these factors? The theory was missing, but the empirics were undeniable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Act III - The Modern Challenge (2010s)**: Success bred excess. If three factors work, why not try everything? Researchers discovered hundreds of \"factors\" - from momentum to profitability to investment patterns. We now face the **Factor Zoo** problem: which factors are real economic forces, and which are just data mining artifacts? Enter machine learning: algorithms that can systematically separate signal from noise.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔗 The Connecting Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "All three parts revolve around one fundamental equation:\n",
    "$$P_t = E_t[M_{t+1} X_{t+1}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M_{t+1}$ is the **Stochastic Discount Factor** (SDF) - the \"price of risk.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 1**: We try to measure $M$ using consumption data. It doesn't work.\n",
    "- **Part 2**: We proxy $M$ using portfolio returns. It works empirically.\n",
    "- **Part 3**: We use machine learning to find the best proxy for $M$ in high dimensions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🎯 The Hansen-Jagannathan Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) derived a powerful inequality. For any valid SDF, it must satisfy:\n",

    "- The Sharpe ratio is around 0.38\n",
    "- To match this with consumption data, we need γ ≈ 11\n",

    "## 🎉 Summary: The Evolution of Asset Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab showed you the 40-year journey of asset pricing research:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Act I: The Crisis (1985)\n",
    "**Problem**: Consumption-based models fail spectacularly\n",
    "- Required risk aversion (γ ≈ 11) is 2-10× too high\n",
    "- Consumption too smooth to explain volatile stock returns\n",
    "- **Lesson**: Beautiful theory doesn't always match reality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Act II: The Empirical Fix (1993)\n",
    "**Solution**: Use portfolio returns as factors instead\n",
    "- Three factors (Market, Size, Value) explain 60-80% of returns\n",
    "- Works brilliantly empirically, but lacks theoretical foundation\n",
    "- **Lesson**: Sometimes data must lead theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Act III: The Modern Challenge (2015+)\n",
    "**Problem**: Factor proliferation → 400+ proposed factors\n",
    "**Solution**: Machine learning for variable selection\n",
    "- Lasso's L1 penalty automatically identifies true factors\n",
    "- Achieves 85%+ sparsity with minimal loss in fit\n",
    "- **Lesson**: Regularization prevents overfitting in high dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 The Connecting Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "All three parts revolve around the Stochastic Discount Factor:\n",
    "$$P_t = E_t[M_{t+1} X_{t+1}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 1**: Measure M from consumption → fails\n",
    "- **Part 2**: Proxy M with portfolio returns → works\n",
    "- **Part 3**: Find best proxy when we have many candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Key Takeaways for \"AI for Economists\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Economics First**: ML is a tool, not the goal. Start with economic questions.\n",
    "2. **Theory Guides Data**: Even Fama-French is motivated by risk-based theories\n",
    "3. **Regularization Matters**: With high dimensions, penalization prevents overfitting\n",
    "4. **Interpretation Essential**: Betas and alphas have economic meaning beyond statistics\n",
    "5. **Honest About Limits**: We still don't fully understand why factors work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these extensions:\n",
    "- Estimate models for different stocks (tech vs banks vs utilities)\n",
    "- Test time-varying betas using rolling windows\n",
    "- Compare Lasso vs Ridge vs Elastic Net\n",
    "- Implement the 5-factor model (add profitability and investment)\n",
    "- Apply to international markets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: The goal isn't to find the perfect model. It's to understand the economic forces driving asset prices while being humble about what we don't know."
